This process continues until all data points are in the same cluster. The result is a dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that shows the hierarchy of clusters and the order in which they were merged. Agglomerative clustering is widely used and has a time complexity of O(n^3).\n",

The splitting process is based on some distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. Divisive clustering is less commonly used than agglomerative clustering because it is computationally expensive and has a time complexity of O(2^n)."

    "\n",

The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates that the data point is well-matched to its cluster, while a score closer to -1 indicates that the data point is more similar to a neighboring cluster. The optimal number of clusters is determined by the highest average silhouette score.\n",

    "One way to identify outliers using hierarchical clustering is to use a dendrogram to examine the height of the branches in the tree. Outliers are likely to be represented by singletons or small clusters with a large height. The height of a cluster in the dendrogram represents the distance between the points in the cluster, so a large height indicates that the points are very different from each other and from the other points in the dataset.\n",

    "Another way to identify outliers is to use a distance threshold to define a cut-off point in the dendrogram. Data points that are merged into clusters above the distance threshold are considered to be outliers. This approach can be useful if there is prior knowledge about the expected distribution of the data, or if there is a clear separation between the clusters and outliers.\n",
