The value of K that gives the best performance on the validation set can be chosen through cross-validation.\n",

    "When the features are on different scales, some features may have a disproportionately large effect on the distance calculation, which can bias the classification or regression result. For example, if one feature has a much larger range of values than the others, it can dominate the distance calculation and overshadow the effects of other features.\n",

    "Min-max scaling involves scaling the feature values to a range between 0 and 1. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and dividing by the range of the feature. Standardization involves transforming the feature values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Normalization involves scaling the feature values to have a unit norm, which means that the sum of the squared feature values is equal to 1.\n",
