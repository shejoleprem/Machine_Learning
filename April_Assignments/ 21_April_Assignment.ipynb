    "1) Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a common technique used to determine the optimal value of k. In this technique, the data is split into k folds, and the algorithm is trained and tested k times. The average accuracy or mean squared error is calculated for each value of k, and the k value that results in the highest accuracy or lowest mean squared error is chosen as the optimal value.\n",

This method can be computationally expensive for large datasets, but it can be effective for small datasets.\n",

It is commonly used for categorical variables or variables that have a limited range of values.\n",

    "4) Minkowski distance: The Minkowski distance is a generalized distance metric that includes the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance as special cases. The Minkowski distance has a parameter p that determines the degree of sensitivity to the magnitude of the feature values. When p=1, the Minkowski distance is equivalent to the Manhattan distance, and when p=2, it is equivalent to the Euclidean distance."
