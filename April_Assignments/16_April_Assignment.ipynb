    "1) Number of iterations: This parameter determines the number of weak models that are trained in the boosting algorithm. A higher number of iterations can lead to better accuracy, but it maybe leads to overfitting.\n",

    "2) Learning rate: The learning rate controls the contribution of each weak model to the final model. A lower learning rate will give each model less weight, while a higher learning rate will give each model more weight. A learning rate that is too high can lead to overfitting, while a learning rate that is too low can slow down the training process.\n",

    "\n",
    "4) Regularization parameters: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Boosting algorithms can have different regularization parameters, such as L1 or L2 regularization, i.e. Lasso Regression or Ridge Regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "5) Sample weighting: Boosting algorithms often assign different weights to the training examples based on their importance or difficulty. The weights can be adjusted to control the focus of the algorithm on specific features.\n",
